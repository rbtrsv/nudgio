            Nudgio is a SaaS ecommerce recommendation engine. The Service connects to your ecommerce store (Shopify, WooCommerce, or Magento) via API or database connection, imports your product and order data, and generates AI-powered product recommendations (bestsellers, cross-sell, upsell, and similar products) that you can embed on your store.

              By connecting your ecommerce store to Nudgio, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to grant us access to your store&apos;s product and order data through the APIs or database credentials you provide. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of Nudgio complies with the terms of service of your ecommerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, or Magento). For Shopify merchants, your use of Nudgio is also subject to Shopify&apos;s API Terms of Service and Partner Program Agreement.

              We encrypt all API credentials (access tokens, consumer keys, consumer secrets, and database passwords) at rest. However, you are responsible for safeguarding the credentials you provide and for revoking access through your ecommerce platform if you believe your credentials have been compromised.

              For merchants who install Nudgio from the Shopify App Store, subscription billing is processed through Shopify&apos;s Billing API and charges appear in your Shopify admin. For all other platforms (WooCommerce, Magento), paid subscriptions are billed monthly through Stripe. By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize us to charge the applicable payment method at the beginning of each billing cycle. All fees are non-refundable except as required by applicable law.

              You may cancel your subscription at any time through the Stripe Customer Portal. Upon cancellation, your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period. After that, your account reverts to the Free tier with its associated limits.

            <p className="font-normal max-sm:text-sm sm:text-base dark:text-white text-black mb-6">
              If a payment fails, we provide a 7-day grace period during which your service continues at the current tier. If payment is not resolved within this period, your account will be downgraded and access to paid features will be restricted.
